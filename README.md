# To-Do List App (Redux-Only)

This is a simple yet powerful **To-Do List App** built entirely using **Redux for state management**. Unlike traditional React apps that use local state (`useState`), this application leverages Redux for global state management, making it highly scalable and efficient.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Redux-Powered State Management** – No `useState`, only Redux!  
✅ **Add & Remove Tasks**  
✅ **Mark Tasks as Completed**  
✅ **Filter Tasks (All, Active, Completed)**  
✅ **Attractive UI with Animations**  
✅ **Built by Pradeep Kumar** ✨

## 🎨 Why This App is Unique?

- This app is different because it relies entirely on **Redux** for handling the to-do list operations.
- It demonstrates how to manage **global state effectively** in a React application.
- Best for learning **Redux concepts like reducers, actions, and the store.**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Frontend Framework)
- **Redux Toolkit** (State Management)
- **CSS** (For Styling)
